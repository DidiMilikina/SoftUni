            <p>The Force Awakens was announced after the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It
                was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams
                and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Bak (1980), rewrote an initial
                script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the film's
                score.
            </p>
            <p>Lucas served as creative consultant during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi
                and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in England and
                concluded in November 2014. It is the first live-action film in the franchise since Star Wars: Episode III
                - Revenge of the Sith, released ten years prior in 2005.
